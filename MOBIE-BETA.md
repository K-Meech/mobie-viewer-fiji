# MoBIE Beta

The MoBIE-beta update site ships the very latest version of MoBIE, which may **not be compatible** with the current one from the official MoBIE update site.

If you want to try out MoBIE-beta we recommend doing this in a dedicated Fiji, e.g. stored in a folder on your Desktop with the name `Fiji-MoBIE-beta.app`.

To try MoBIE-beta you need to:

1. Open a Fiji
2. [ Help > Update... ]
3. [ Manage Update Sites ]
4. Manually add the update site: <img width="428" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2157566/115389059-e9a95d80-a1dc-11eb-8e4e-8238f0e038e0.png">
5. [ Close ]
6. Restart Fiji
